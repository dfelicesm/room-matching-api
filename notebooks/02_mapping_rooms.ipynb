However, for the sake of simplicity, and to avoid the heavy installation of `SentenceTransformers` (which requires downloading PyTorch), I will use RapidFuzz instead. RapidFuzz does not capture semantic similarity, but since I am already blocking obvious non-matches, it should work well enough for this exercise."
